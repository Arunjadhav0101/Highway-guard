Pioneers in Highway Sustainability
India's highways are vital for transportation and economic growth. However, indiscriminate littering from vehicles pollutes the environment, harms wildlife, and creates safety hazards. Current manual collection methods are inefficient.
Highway Guard, a revolutionary Al-powered system, automates real-time waste detection, fostering responsible disposal practices and significantly contributing to the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Mission). This document outlines the project's concept, functionalities, potential impact, and alignment with the Clean India mission.
